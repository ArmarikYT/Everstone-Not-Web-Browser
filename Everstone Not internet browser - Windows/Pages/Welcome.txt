Welcome to Everstone Not Web Browser.

This app acts like web browser, but it is not.
It uses .txt files as webpages.
It's nothing special but it works!
If you want to create your own page only for you, go to C:/EverstoneNWB/Pages and create new text file.
You can name it however you want, but be sure you remember the full name.

Enjoy!
